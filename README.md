## Description
This project uses OOP programming in order to take in inputs from the user and generates a Profile Page that utilizes grid and cards. 

## Installation
1. Clone Dream Team Profile Generator to a local file. 2. Download the required NPM file by typing "npm install". 3. Open your terminal. 4. Type "node index". 5. Follow prompts to generate your team.

## Usage
Once you download the correct NPM files, access your terminal and type node index. You will start by filling in your Managers name, ID, Email and Office Number. Once you have filled out this section you will get a prompt to add an Engineer or an Intern or end your additions. You can add multiple of each selection. Once you have built your team and select the prompt, your profile index will be generated in the DIST folder.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the project, it would be nice to add a verification method in the Inquirer prompt in order to verify that information has been inputed properly.

## Tests
You could update the tests by adding additional roles or prompts for each section.
